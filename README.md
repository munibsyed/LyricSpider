# LyricSpider
A spider built with Scrapy that can be used to fetch, parse and analyze song lyrics from various lyric sites.

Planned Functionality:

-Search for an album name. LyricSpider will query popular lyric sites and retrieve relevant lyrics on a song by song basis.

-Labeling songs as 'explicit' or 'clean'.

-Using genius.com's album list to extract a large amount of lyrics, at which point key lyrics and phrases can be searched for using search queries.
